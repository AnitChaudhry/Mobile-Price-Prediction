# Mobile-Price-Prediction
### About Dataset

Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc.

He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive mobile phone market you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.

Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. So he needs your help to solve this problem.
In this problem you do not have to predict actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

## About Machine Learning

I have implemented a Mobile Price Prediction using different Machine Learning Algorithms. This project will classify the price range of the mobile price. The price ranges from 0-3. We???ll discuss the price range in the dataset. Now I have trained a mobile price classification using 3 ML algorithms. This model classifies the range of the mobile based on the different parameters like from camera, touch screen, cores, battery, clock speed, internal memory, battery capacity, etc. After training the model using 3 algorithms, I compared all the models using the graph.
